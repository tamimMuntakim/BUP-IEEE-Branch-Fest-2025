            excerpt:
                "Aqua Paints, a brand of Octagon Fibres and Chemicals Ltd., is a leading Bangladeshi producer recognized for its legacy, vertically integrated manufacturing, and commitment to world-class, climate-adapted paint solutions.",
            content: `
Octagon Fibres and Chemicals Ltd., also known as Aqua Paints, is a leading Bangladeshi producer of paints, coatings, and specialty chemicals. Its journey began with Late Serajuddin Ahmed, who founded “Kumir Marka Alkatra” in 1952 and later expanded into major business sectors. To meet the growing demand for industrial paints, his sons set up a state-of-the-art factory in Tongi, Gazipur and launched Aqua Paints in 2001. The brand is recognized for uncompromising quality, with raw materials sourced from Germany, France, Switzerland, and Vietnam. The company also produces essential intermediates through backward linkage including acrylic emulsions and alkyd resins.

3. Leadership Team:

*Ramzul Seraj, Managing Director*
- Ramzul Seraj, a Chemical Engineering graduate from the University of Birmingham with a Master’s from the University of Aston, is the visionary founder who established Aqua Paints in 2001. His strong leadership and dedication to product excellence have transformed the company into one of Bangladesh’s most trusted and advanced paint manufacturers.

*Sajedur Seraj, Deputy Managing Director*
- He plays a pivotal role in leading the family’s diversified businesses with a strong focus on innovation and operational excellence.

*Shayaan Seraj, Director*
- Shayaan Seraj, a University of Toronto graduate with global advertising experience at WPP, Interpublic, and Publicis, returned to Bangladesh to lead Strategy, Operations & Marketing at Aqua Paints. His award-winning leadership and modern brand vision are driving Aqua Paints and the Elite Group toward a more innovative, youth-driven future.


4. Innovation & Product Development:

Aqua Paints is not just a paint company — they are vertically integrated, meaning they manufacture both paints and critical raw materials (resins, chemical agents). 

They are designing their products to be particularly resilient to tough environmental conditions (heat, humidity, salinity), making them very suited to the Bangladeshi climate. 

For sustainability, they are scaling up eco-friendly formulations (low or zero-VOC). 

They also use digital innovation: e.g., InstaColor tinting machines for quick color matching, and AI tools to recommend colors based on room lighting and user preferences. 

Aqua is pursuing international certifications to elevate its quality standards, such as testing with SIRIM QAS International. 


5. Social & Community Contributions:

Aqua Paints supports youth-led initiatives: for example, they provided paints and umbrellas to young volunteers to help beautify public spaces by transforming vandalized walls through art. Aqua Paints recently unveiled a vibrant national-themed mural at the BFF House—featuring female, male, and youth players—beautifully finished with their premium outercoat Defender, in a ceremony graced by Hamza Chowdhury.

This shows their commitment not only to business but also to community development and social responsibility. 


6. Safety, Quality & Standards

In their technical data sheets (TDS), they emphasize guidelines for safe paint application, proper mixing, ventilation, and health precautions. 

They also state that their paints are free from added lead, mercury, arsenic, and chromium, which is a strong plus for safety and environmental compliance. 


7. Future Outlook

- Aqua seems well-positioned to expand regionally, leveraging its technical depth, global partnerships, and integrated production. 

- With climate-adapted coatings (e.g., anti-saline, rooftop elastomeric), they are targeting both local demand (houses, buildings in Bangladesh) and maintain export quality.  

- Their focus on digital design tools, AI, and smart color experience could help them appeal to design-conscious homeowners and architects.
